<article><header>  <p>posted by BGB, November 15, 2016</p></header><h2>Low and Slow</h2><p>This week I am <em>extremely</em> excited about a new cooking technique called <em>sous vide</em>. In <em>sous vide</em> cooking, you submerge the food (usually vacuum-sealed in plastic) into a water bath that is precisely set to the target temperature you want the food to be cooked to. In his book, <em>Cooking for Geeks</em>, Jeff Potter describes it as "ultra-low-temperature poaching".</p><p>Next month, we will be serving <b><em>Sous Vide</em> Salmon with Dill Hollandaise</b>. To reserve a seat at the chef table, contact us before November 30.</p><p>blackgoose@example.com555-336-1800</p><p>Warning: <em>Sous vide</em> cooked salmon is not pasteurized. Avoid it if you are pregnant or have immunity issues.</p></article>
